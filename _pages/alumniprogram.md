<p>Pale Kai is happy to launch our 2018 Alumni Paddle Program! Even if your racing days are over, we would like to encourage our long lost ohana to return to the ocean sport they love. Alumni are invited to participate in regular Monday and Saturday practices throughout the season, and in offseason paddling. </p>

<p>Alumni yearly dues are $200 and cover all your paddles from March 1st, 2018 thru February 28th, 2019.</p>

<p>For further questions about our Alumni Program, reach out to our membership director, Julie. To sign up for the 2018 Alumni Program head on over to our <a href="http://www.palekai.org/members/registration/">2018 Member Registration</a>.</p>
