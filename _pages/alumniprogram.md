<h2>Alumni Paddling Program</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<p> Pale Kai is happy to announce our new Alumni Paddle Program! Even if your racing days are over, we would like to encourage our long lost ohana to return to the ocean sport they love...no pressure! We are now offering go-outs on Sunday mornings at 9am, led by one of our founding uncles, Bill Hurley. </p>
		<p>
		If you are interested, read the PKO Alumni Paddling Program Policy.</p>
<p>
The basic paperwork requirements are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>current SCORA waiver (1-page, double-sided only)</li>
		<li>PKO code of conduct (read & sign)</li>
		<li>PKO safety policy (read & sign)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
You must also update your SCORA ID# on the SCORA website www.scora.org in order to be covered by insurance.
	</p>
	<P>
The basic safety requirements are:
	</P>
<ol>
	<li>swim around the canoe without touching it</li>
	<li>get back into the canoe</li>
	<li>huli drill</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
You can sign up for upcoming go-outs by going to our fancy new Sign-up Genius. It's easy and doesn't require a password. This will allow everyone to see if there are enough people to fill a canoe (no less than 5 paddlers allowed).
