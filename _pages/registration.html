<h4>Good to Know</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Your membership is good for through the end of February 2027.</li>
	<li>Dues for 2026 are $390 ($200 for full-time students).</li>
</ul>

<p>Complete the following steps to sign up for a great year of paddling with Pale Kai Outrigger!</p>

<h4>#1: Create (or Update) your SCORA Account</h4>
<P>Go to <a  href="https://www.scora.org/login/" target="_blank">https://www.scora.org/login/</a>. New paddlers
will need to create a free SCORA account. Make a note of your SCORA ID. Once your SCORA registration is complete, you will be sent to
Smartwaiver to sign your waiver. </p>

<p>Returning paddlers should ensure their contact info is correct and sign the Smartwaiver. (Note: If you've already signed the Smartwaiver this calendar year,
you won't be given the option to sign another. That's okay, just move on.)</P>

<p>Be aware that when prompted for your SCORA ID in Smartwaiver you MUST include the SC prefix.</p>

<p>After completing your Smartwaiver you'll be emailed a link to your completed Smartwaiver PDF. We recommend that you download and save it; 
the link is only good for three days and you may be asked for it later. </p>

<h4>#2: Annual PKO Member Registration</h4>

<p>PKO uses TeamSnap to manage our membership roster, collect dues, schedule workouts, races, and other events, and to 
communicate with members. When you tap the button below, you'll be taken to TeamSnap where you can register for the
current year; In one swoop, you’ll accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create or update your TeamSnap profile and link it to PKO</li>
	<li>Initial the PKO Safety and Code of Conduct Policies</li>
	<li>Select your payment method for dues - online (credit/debit/ACH) or offline (Venmo/Check/Cash)</li>
	<li>And relax... because you just signed up for a great year of paddling!</li>
