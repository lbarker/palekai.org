This year, we’ve enlisted the help of TeamSnap again to streamline our member registration process. In one swoop, you’ll accomplish the following things:
1. Sign up for a new TeamSnap account -- OR -- import an existing TeamSnap account
2. Complete your member profile including emergency contact info
3. Sign the PKO Code of Conduct Policy
4. Sign the PKO Saftey Policy
5. Upload your completed 2019 SCORA smartwaiver
6. Select your payment method for dues - online or offline. 
7. And relax... because you just signed up for another year paddling!

### TeamSnap What?
It's a cloud-based team management service that makes it super easy to communicate with your teammates. It's like Facebook... but just for us. Last year we introduced TeamSnap to help with our internal communications and it went pretty good. So we're doing it again this year!
