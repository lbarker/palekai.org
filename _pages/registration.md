## Here's what you're going to do

This year, we’ve enlisted the help of TeamSnap again to streamline our member registration process. In one swoop, you’ll accomplish the following things:
1. Sign up for a new TeamSnap account/player -- OR -- import an existing TeamSnap account/player
2. Complete your member profile including emergency contact info
3. Sign the PKO Code of Conduct Policy
4. Sign the PKO Saftey Policy
5. Download your 2018 SCORA waiver and get information about the new smart waivers
6. Pay your dues online or opt to pay our treasurer directly 
7. And relax... because you just signed up for another year paddling!

### TeamSnap What?
It's a cloud-based team management service that makes it super easy to communicate with your teammates. It's like Facebook... but just for us. Last year we introduced TeamSnap to help with our internal communications and it went pretty good. So we're doing it again this year!
