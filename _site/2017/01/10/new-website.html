		<p><p>FALL 2016 DEMO DAYS ARE HERE!</p>

<p>OCTOBER 1, 2016
Aloha, potential PKO paddlers of 2017!!</p>

<p>We have entered into our recruitment season and are looking for adventurous, athletic, ocean-savvy new paddlers! Our coaches will teach you basic technique and water safety. You will enjoy time on the ocean encountering beautiful central coast marine life, while learning how to paddle a Hawaiian-style outrigger canoe with the guidance of our experienced paddlers.</p>

<p>Join us at our fall recruitment DEMO DAYS, scheduled for October 16, and November 12. Each demo day will have two sessions, beginning at 8:30 am, and 10:00 am, at Coleman Park Beach, Morro Bay.</p>

<p>If you enjoy your experience and want to continue, you will be welcome to join our novice training, which starts in January, in the calm waters of Morro Bay.</p>

<p>You may pre-register for either Demo Day in one of two ways:</p>

<p>1) Email our Membership Coordinator with “I’m IN!”</p>

<p>2) Go to our Facebook Page, or event Page and join.</p>

<p>Mahalo for your interest! See you on the beach! *B-) cool</p>

<p>PRIVATE: NOVICE SEASON 2016—TAKING SIGN UPS!</p>

<p>JANUARY 21, 2016
January 17, 2016 marked Pale Kai Outrigger’s first novice practice of the year. Novice practice is by sign up only, on Sundays in Coleman Park (Morro Bay).</p>

<p>Please contact Membership Coordinator, Mandy O’Connell for more information.</p>

<p>PKO DOES THE ZONGO CUP</p>

<p>AUGUST 14, 2015
Today marks the Zongo Yachting Cup, and Pale Kai Outrigger’s third consecutive year of participation. While PKO hasn’t attached sails to its canoes, we’re grateful to Paul Irving, organizer of the event, to allow diversification of class in this traditional sailing event. This year will feature, in addition to our outriggers, a SUP class, multi-hull and power boat class. With more than 50 vessels expected to participate today, this makes for one of the most exciting offshore races on the California Coast!</p>

2013 Zongo Race</p>

<p>11880312_10205864892676204_1591105738239761880_n
Keeping pace with a double hull vessel on the Central Coast waters between Morro Bay and Avila Beach</p>

<p>Today, PKO sends out two crews and canoes, launching from Morro Bay this morning at 11, and making the trek all the way into Avila Beach. For outriggers, this race can be done as an iron, or a 9-man. Race finishers are rewarded with an after party like no other—Michael Franti and Spearhead concert at Avila Bay Golf Course, not to mention a Food Truck Festival coinciding with the concert.</p>

<p>11885657_10205864842874959_3891294186093803021_o</p>

<p>Friends, Family, Sailing and Waterman Fans join in the fun today and see-off the crews from Morro Bay this morning, then head over  to Avila Beach for an afternoon finish (~2pm for our outriggers), and grab a ticket to the after party. It will be a Friday to set the bar for the rest of your weekend.</p>

<p>Let’s hope for “hardware” of a different kind today, the ultimate Zongo Award, PKO is anxious to add another one of these beauties to its collection.</p>

<p>10556222_10152336900235888_4819165735355927887_n</p>

<p>Something that PKO members ponder a lot over beers at Ricks, or a BBQ on our home beach after a 20 mile practice on our gorgeous central coast waters rings especially true today: Who’s got it better than us?</p>

NOVICE TRAINING BEGINS JAN. 18 2015!</p>

<p>DECEMBER 26, 2014
The date is set for the Pale Kai Outrigger’s first novice practice of 2015. Beginning Sunday, January 18, 2015 there will be two practice times to choose from –8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Please join us at Coleman Park in Morro Bay (see map: https://goo.gl/maps/5acy0). Practices are by sign up only!  Sign up requests will be sent out by our Membership Coordinator, Kristen Sanchez each week, so please check your email to ensure a seat on a canoe each week.</p>

<p>Additional details about what to expect during Novice Training will be coming during the next few weeks. Feel free to send your questions to Kristen Sanchez and she will incorporate answers in the next email.</p>

<p>A message from your coaching staff:</p>

<p>We are really excited for the 2015 novice season! Last year was a huge success, and we are well positioned to continue to build.</p>

<p>Not only will you learn the technique of outrigger paddling, you will also learn about the history and culture of the sport, as well as important safety information.</p>

<p>You will get to meet some of our veterans, who generously donate their time to make sure you have a great experience.  Your primary coaches in the novice season are Stacey and Bill; our other 3 coaches are Scott, Tamara and Pat.</p>

<p>We are ALL committed to providing an AWESOME experience, on and off the water!</p>

<p>The coaches are working hard to prepare for practices in Morro Bay, and so should YOU!  If you haven’t been to the gym recently, now is the time! With the first practice just one month away, it’s important to cross train (strength training, cardio AND stretching). Don’t wait until after the holidays!</p>

<p>As a racing club, our goal is always to be competitive, and represent the Central Coast at each race’s award ceremony! And, it’s going to be such fun along the way!</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you all, and until then, have a wonderful holiday season!</p>

<p>DEMO DAY 2014 #1!</p>

<p>SEPTEMBER 29, 2014
What an amazing Demo Day we had out on Avila Beach! Thank you to all that came out and learned a little about our sport. We appreciate everyone’s participation, and hope to see you again during Novice Training in January.</p>

<p>If you missed our Demo Day, please join us for our second Demo Day on October 19. We will meet at Avila Beach at 9 am.</p>

<p>DEMO DAYS ARE BACK! COME PADDLE WITH PALE KAI!</p>
