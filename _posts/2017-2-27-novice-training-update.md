Aloha all potential PKO Novice,

I (Novice Coach Tom) welcome you to Pale Kai Outrigger (PKO).  Below you will find all the information needed to become a novice member of PKO. So let the info begin!  First and foremost is that PKO is a competitive racing club which expects a certain level of commitment to join. Please review the following information thoroughly so you know what to expect from me and PKO. 

### Novice Men/Women practice logistics:

Gear to bring to every practice: water clothing (this is a water sport), dry clothing, hydration, water footwear, towel, (optional) visor, sunglasses, sunscreen

### Training Schedule: 2~3 hrs
* 1st practice - Sat. 3/11 - 8 am - PKO clubsite, Avila Beach (dry-land training)
* 2nd/3rd practices - Mon. 3/13 & Wed. 3/15 - 5 pm. - Morro Bay, Coleman Beach (water/paddling training)
* 4th and forever - Sat. 12 noon - M/W 5 pm - PKO clubsite, Avila Beach 

Below are 3 videos that I would like you to watch prior to your 1st practice. 
We will be discussing this info thru-out the paddling season.
