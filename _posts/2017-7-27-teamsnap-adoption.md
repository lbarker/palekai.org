One part of the 2017 PKO Communication Strategy was to improve internal communications and information sharing among it's members. In the past, we've simply used direct email and practice for making announcements. This works well for small teams, but as our club grew we noticed a few issues. These included:
* Too many emails being sent to our members
* Group emails being sent with everyone listed in the "to" field ... and the dreaded "reply all" accidently being used. This resulted in what was meant to be a private conversation between two members being broadcasted to entire team. OOPS!
* Some members dont even use email!
* Not everyone is at every practice, so in practice announcement to reach the entire membership.
* Team rosters were inconsistent

## Fix #1 - We Adopted MailChimp
Starting in 2017, we starting using MailChimp to build and deploy email communciations. This allowed us to integrate an email sign up form directly on the website, centralize our email lists, build beautiful HTML emails, and review analytics. Two types of communications were designated: 
1. The PKO Bulletin - a newsletter like publication sent to all emails in our database. It includes tips and tricks for paddling, PKO news and public events, and general info that the surronding community could be interested in. 
2. Membership Announcements - member only announcements. These communciations typically included race packets, linkes to contact sheets, rosters, canoe loading, ect. The kind of information that only active members would need to know. 

However, MailChimp fell short in one critical area of communications - the coaches. Our coaches need to easily and quicly contact all members of the team. This could be for a change in practice time, the days workout agenda, race crews, ect. There was also a need for SMS alerts. 

## Fix #2 - Google Forms for Race Availbility
We also starte using Google Forms to gather who could attend what races. This process was done by word-of-mouth in years past. We used Google Forms for Iron Season Registratin and 9 Man Season Registration along with a few membership surveys. They worked . . . but the membership didn't seen that excited about them. We needed something even better.
