The date is set for the Pale Kai Outrigger’s first novice practice of 2015. Beginning Sunday, January 18, 2015 there will be two practice times to choose from –8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Please join us at Coleman Park in Morro Bay (see map: https://goo.gl/maps/5acy0). Practices are by sign up only!  Sign up requests will be sent out by our Membership Coordinator, Kristen Sanchez each week, so please check your email to ensure a seat on a canoe each week.

Additional details about what to expect during Novice Training will be coming during the next few weeks. Feel free to send your questions to Kristen Sanchez and she will incorporate answers in the next email.

A message from your coaching staff:

We are really excited for the 2015 novice season! Last year was a huge success, and we are well positioned to continue to build.

Not only will you learn the technique of outrigger paddling, you will also learn about the history and culture of the sport, as well as important safety information.

You will get to meet some of our veterans, who generously donate their time to make sure you have a great experience.  Your primary coaches in the novice season are Stacey and Bill; our other 3 coaches are Scott, Tamara and Pat.

We are ALL committed to providing an AWESOME experience, on and off the water!

The coaches are working hard to prepare for practices in Morro Bay, and so should YOU!  If you haven’t been to the gym recently, now is the time! With the first practice just one month away, it’s important to cross train (strength training, cardio AND stretching). Don’t wait until after the holidays!

As a racing club, our goal is always to be competitive, and represent the Central Coast at each race’s award ceremony! And, it’s going to be such fun along the way!

Looking forward to seeing you all, and until then, have a wonderful holiday season!
