This exceptional tasting of Vincent Vineyards 2010 Reserve Flight will include a Sparkling Brut, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and a Petit Verdot. We will also be tasting wines in the barrel with their signature truffle. These six custom truffles are created by our local artesian Chocolatier Ben Taylor.
