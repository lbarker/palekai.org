Pale Kai is heading to San Diego this weekend for the 1st race of the 2017 Iron Season. For the first time ever, Pale Kai women will be competing in the unlimited division! Our men have been looking strong and even paddling together on their OC1's a few days a week. The novice teams look well practiced and at ease thanks to coach Tom. 

We'll be at the Crystal Pier race site Saturday morning - so keep a steady eye out for the purple and yellow team having the most fun.
