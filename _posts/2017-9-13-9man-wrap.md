Pale Kai Outrigger sent two teams to the Catalina Crossing this year. At the end of the womens race, all 9 team members, the change coach, and the womens coach celebrated the 30 mile crossing in style. We even got Captain Pat, our chase boat drivir, in the background for this picture. 

Who has it better than PKO? NOBODY!
