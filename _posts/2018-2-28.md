Some of our friends in Southern California are at risk of losing coastal access due to the ever-shifting policies of the California Coastal Commission. 

In response, SCORA and Casey White, are working with the California State Parks Division of Boating and Waterways to survey the non-motorized boating community about access, fees, safety, wants/needs, etc. The survey's data and responses will be used when setting policy for our waterways.

This could have broad impact associated with coastal access, SCORA races, and the outrigger community as a whole.

So if you have a moment, take the survey and help our outrigger community out. There's even a free gift! Download the flyer for more information and pass along to other ocean loving members of your community.
