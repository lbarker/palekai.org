On April 22, 2017 the PKO BBQ at Avila was a success! There was a blessing of our canoes and all our paddlers, Hawaiian entertainment, welcoming our Novice crews, raffle, and lots of Onolicious food!!! Mahalo to all the volunteers (members) to make it happen! And my nephew who said the blessings in Hawaiian. And most thanks too "Ke Akua (God)" for giving us this beautiful day!!!

Take a look at some of those photos below. 

Mahalo!
