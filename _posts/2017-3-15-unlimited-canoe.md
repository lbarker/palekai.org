I hope this message finds everyone doing well.  I have been very proud of all the work the coaches have been doing to get the season off to a great start.  I had an awesome time at the fitness test and really enjoyed seeing everyone! Soon we will all be on the water and having fun very soon!

PKO will be welcoming its second unlimited canoe this season!  

We would like to have the canoe named and a small blessing prior to putting the boat in the water.

I know we are all anxious to get into the new boat, so I am asking paddlers to send canoe name suggestions to Tamara at #805-709-3542 tjones2296@aol.com by Monday, 3/20. We will then vote on the names at the 3/21 all member board meeting and plan to have a blessing somewhere in the near future.

Take good care of yourself and see you all Saturday!
