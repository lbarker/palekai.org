John Hergert is putting together a PKO paddle order for Puakea paddles. View the complete price sheet here. Please submit your order request if you would like to participate in this deal.

<blockquote>
	“The Puakea double-bend is a light, all-carbon paddle that features enough flex to be easy on the joints. So unlike most carbon paddles, it does not cause elbow or shoulder joint problems with prolonged use. The very slight scoop on the leading edge of the blade allows it to enter the water cleanly, with a nice catch, yet allows it to exit quickly and cleanly as well. At the catch position, the double-bend oval shaft promotes a comfortable, loose grip and relaxed wrist.”
