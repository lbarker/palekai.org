Hi PKO Team,

Before we start the season I want to take a minute to get to know everyone and get a better understanding of you as an athlete and what you hope to achieve this next year. I have attached a paddler profile sheet that I would like you all to fill out and send back to me. If you could also attach a photo of yourself that would be awesome! I know we all have rad paddling photos but if you could send me a photo where I can actually see your face that would be really helpful :) Take your time with the profile and send it my way by January 14th, 2017. 

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out. Other than that have a great holiday and get ready to train hard and have a lot of fun next season!! 

Cheers!
