Novice training will enter its third week, this Sunday, at Coleman Park in Morro Bay.

If you havenâ€™t signed up yet for Novice Training, please contact our Membership Coordinator, Kristen, and book yourself a spot on a canoe for next week.

The weather and water temps are still decent and the work outs are fun! Our new coaching staff has been spending a lot of time on land and in the water covering stroke technique. Download our paddling guide before your next practice!
