Pale Kai Outrigger had a blast at the Morro Bay Lighted Boat Parade on Sat, Dec 8. We lit up a double-hull canoe and decked ourselves out in holiday cheer! We were one of the few unmotorized entries in the parade...all paddle power! Lots of fun! (Special thanks to Scott Bixler for trailering the canoes from/to Avila Beach.)
