## 2017 Practice Schedule

### Schedule:
**First day of Vet Practice** 
March 18th Women will practice Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Men will be Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. I plan to attend 1 day a week with the men and 1 with the women. This will be our technique day. We will still have a high-intensity workout but our focus with be on the stroke and blending. 

Saturdays will be combined and working on both technique and cardio training. ALWAYS BRING SHOES TO PRACTICE. If the conditions are bad, and we do not go out on the water we will do land training! Come prepared. The coaches will be making the call as to whether we go out and paddle or not. If neither coach is at practice well will assign someone to take point. 

**First day of Novice Practice** 
First day of Novice practice is March 12th. More information coming soon.

## Fitness Testing
Fitness testing will be on March 11th and 12th from 12-2pm at the Avila Bay Club.

- **5k meter erg**<br/>If you have access to an erg ( rowing machine) please complete this before hand and send me a picture of your screen once you have completed the 5,000 meters.
