Aloha PKO paddlers and Happy New Year! 

I hope you all have been having a restful, rejuvenating winter and are starting to get excited about the upcoming paddling season! 

Hey! I have an idea for a good get-together, team-building activity we could do during the off-season! Let's do a ROADSIDE CLEAN-UP!! 

Yes, we are a little overdue for our quarterly clean-up and I'd like to arrange our schedule so that it doesn't conflict too much with our race season. So we're getting a jump on it. The schedule will be: Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct. 

The first one will be this weekend....

When: Sunday, Jan 22, 8 am
Where: meet at the PKO site in Avila
Wear: long pants, long sleeves, bright clothes (we have safety vests), closed-toe shoes, gloves

I'm looking for 8 - 10 volunteers to help keep our community and ocean clean.

RAIN CANCELS. Raincheck day is Sunday, Jan 29, 8 am

Please RSVP to Kristen, directly, at: vp@palekai.org

Mahalo,
Kristen Sanchez
PKO, VP
