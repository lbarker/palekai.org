Pale Kai off-season paddling is headquartered at Coleman Beach in Morro Bay. Paddling is scheduled through February. There are three canoes available and sign ups are first-come, first-serve. At least one canoe must have a club-sanctioned Boat Captain. If you are signing up as a Boat Captain, you must also sign up as a paddler. (Just because you are the Boat Captain doesn't mean you have to steer.) If you don't know what qualifies one as a Boat Captain or are not sure of the club's rules for Morro Bay off-season paddling, please contact a board member for more information. 

Canoes must not be taken out of the bay. This is for safety. 

No shows are not appreciated! If you need to cancel please do so at least 1 day in advance so that someone else has the opportunity to take your slot or we can cancel if we don't have enough paddlers.
