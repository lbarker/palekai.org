FALL 2016 DEMO DAYS ARE HERE!

OCTOBER 1, 2016
Aloha, potential PKO paddlers of 2017!!

We have entered into our recruitment season and are looking for adventurous, athletic, ocean-savvy new paddlers! Our coaches will teach you basic technique and water safety. You will enjoy time on the ocean encountering beautiful central coast marine life, while learning how to paddle a Hawaiian-style outrigger canoe with the guidance of our experienced paddlers.

Join us at our fall recruitment DEMO DAYS, scheduled for October 16, and November 12. Each demo day will have two sessions, beginning at 8:30 am, and 10:00 am, at Coleman Park Beach, Morro Bay.

If you enjoy your experience and want to continue, you will be welcome to join our novice training, which starts in January, in the calm waters of Morro Bay.

You may pre-register for either Demo Day in one of two ways: 

1) Email our Membership Coordinator with “I’m IN!”

2) Go to our Facebook Page, or event Page and join.

Mahalo for your interest! See you on the beach! *B-) cool

PRIVATE: NOVICE SEASON 2016—TAKING SIGN UPS!

PKO DOES THE ZONGO CUP

 AUGUST 14, 2015
Today marks the Zongo Yachting Cup, and Pale Kai Outrigger’s third consecutive year of participation. While PKO hasn’t attached sails to its canoes, we’re grateful to Paul Irving, organizer of the event, to allow diversification of class in this traditional sailing event. This year will feature, in addition to our outriggers, a SUP class, multi-hull and power boat class. With more than 50 vessels expected to participate today, this makes for one of the most exciting offshore races on the California Coast!

Today, PKO sends out two crews and canoes, launching from Morro Bay this morning at 11, and making the trek all the way into Avila Beach. For outriggers, this race can be done as an iron, or a 9-man. Race finishers are rewarded with an after party like no other—Michael Franti and Spearhead concert at Avila Bay Golf Course, not to mention a Food Truck Festival coinciding with the concert.

Friends, Family, Sailing and Waterman Fans join in the fun today and see-off the crews from Morro Bay this morning, then head over  to Avila Beach for an afternoon finish (~2pm for our outriggers), and grab a ticket to the after party. It will be a Friday to set the bar for the rest of your weekend.

Let’s hope for “hardware” of a different kind today, the ultimate Zongo Award, PKO is anxious to add another one of these beauties to its collection.

Something that PKO members ponder a lot over beers at Ricks, or a BBQ on our home beach after a 20 mile practice on our gorgeous central coast waters rings especially true today: Who’s got it better than us?

A message from your coaching staff:

We are really excited for the 2015 novice season! Last year was a huge success, and we are well positioned to continue to build.

Not only will you learn the technique of outrigger paddling, you will also learn about the history and culture of the sport, as well as important safety information.

You will get to meet some of our veterans, who generously donate their time to make sure you have a great experience.  Your primary coaches in the novice season are Stacey and Bill; our other 3 coaches are Scott, Tamara and Pat.

We are ALL committed to providing an AWESOME experience, on and off the water!

The coaches are working hard to prepare for practices in Morro Bay, and so should YOU!  If you haven’t been to the gym recently, now is the time! With the first practice just one month away, it’s important to cross train (strength training, cardio AND stretching). Don’t wait until after the holidays!

As a racing club, our goal is always to be competitive, and represent the Central Coast at each race’s award ceremony! And, it’s going to be such fun along the way!

Looking forward to seeing you all, and until then, have a wonderful holiday season!
