ALOHA PKO VETS,
 
My apologies, due to an email glitch, you cannot respond to my first request.  We have fixed the problem, so let's try this again!!

There are 3 new recruit demo days of 2017,  scheduled as follows, in Morro Bay (Coleman Park):

SUNDAY, February 5th at 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.
SUNDAY, February 12th at 08:00 a nd 10:00 a.m.
SUNDAY, February 19th at 08:00 and 10:00 a.m.

We need volunteer veterans (you!) to make this happen: 
 
We have 3 canoes in MB and we need  3 vets (1 steer, 2 other) per canoe, giving us 9 novice seats per go-out. Which means we need 3 steersmen and at least 6 vet paddlers at 08:00 and at 10:00.   I also need at least 2 vets on land (per session) to help check people in and give safety/technique training.
 
Let's keep up the vitality of our club with new recruits!!Â Please use the link below to sign up. 

Also, please complete your  2017 SCORA waiver to turn in to myself or Carrie DeRuyter.  I placed a folder on the bulletin board of the paddling shed to make it easier to turn in, if you do not see me at demo days. You can find the SCORA waiver <a href="/membership/">here</a>.
 
I appreciate your help in making this a successful novice year, 2017!!
 
MAHALO,
 
Laurie Stamper,
Interim Membership Coordinator, (2017)
