Please provide any feedback to me, Denise Morales at buddiedude@hotmail.com prior to the meeting if possible. However, you will have an opportunity to review the documents at the meeting one more time.

In case you were wondering who is this dude who keeps sending you emails?  I am the dude referred to in the email address and my husband, Don Cameron is the Buddie.  It is a very old email address that we jointly established 29 years ago and I can't give it up.
