Dear Pale Kai Canoe Club Members,

How fitting that I write this message on Inauguration Day! I am
excited to take a more active role in PKO’s future and hope this message finds
each of you well.

As announced this fall, my primary focuses will be on fundraising,
culture, and member engagement. I am honored to serve the board as president
and have already enjoyed joining a strong board team in both character and
experience.

We have lots of projects already underway that will continue to
help our club, and our community prosper.
My focus on fundraising is twofold; to help our club purchase
equipment (boat covers, radios, and canoes) as well as fund a highly
anticipated welcoming luau in April.

A big thank you to our outgoing President, Jon Hergert, whose
leadership has helped grow PKO’s racing future by securing our first unlimited
canoe.  Thank you as well to our departing board members, Annette Ausseressess,
Jeff Blauer, Becky Singh, Jesse Perez, Cece Reyes, Mandy O’Connell, _____for
their service.

I would like to welcome our newest board members, Jean Geddes,
Head Coach, Pat Lyons, Women’s Coach, Jon Hergert, Men’s Coach and Equipment,
Tom Needham, Novice Coach, Lauren Barker, Communications, Melvin Amantiad,
Events, Tamara Jones, Fundraising, Laurie Stamper, Membership and Denise
Morales, SCORA representative.

I am also very thankful that Kristen Sanchez (Vice President),
Nancy Needham (Treasurer) and Carrie De Ruyter (Secretary) are all with us for
another year. I respect their experience on the board and appreciate their
advice as we continue to move forward as an organization.

Together I am very optimistic in the direction that we plan to
take Pale Kai Outrigger Canoe Club.

Our January 17th board meeting was successful as we began to outline the things we
hope to accomplish this year. We also welcomed Tamara Jones to the board
to replace Becky Singh as she leaves us for Oregon.

Laurie Stamper has jumped right into the Membership position held
by Mandy O’Connell.  Laurie has spent a lot of effort making sure our club
continues to grow as we hope new recruits will join us this upcoming season.
Please be sure to offer your assistance to her with our upcoming demo days!

Lauren Barker has been hard at work revamping PKO’s web presence.
She shared a few of the ideas she has at our board meeting and we were all
impressed.  Be on the look for the website launch.

Melvin Amantiad and Tamara Jones plan to work collaboratively to
foster a stronger culture presence in PKO in their upcoming events

The coaches, Jean, Jon, Tom and Pat are all working behind the
scenes to plan a challenge practice season for each of you.

I am also proud of Keith Slocum who is working on a project and
giving back to the Central Coast aquarium in Avila by donating his expertise on
a construction project. You will hear more about this in the upcoming months.

As I announced at the meeting, the Board is looking for all of our
members to get involved in one way or another to include: demo days, beach
cleanups, fundraising events, and so forth. These are wonderful ways in which
you can have an impact on our club without making a big time commitment, please
help out.

I look forwarding to seeing you at the next PKO function!
Until then, take good care of yourself!

Sarah Donahue // 
_PKO Club President_
