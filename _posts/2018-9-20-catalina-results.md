We sent 18 paddlers to Catalina, competing with top crews from Tahiti, Hawaii, Canada, and all over California, and came away with 18 trophy tiles! Our open coed spec crew came in 3rd place and our open coed unlimited crew was 9th across the line out of 67 canoes, placing 4th in our division (which earns you a trophy at this race)

Many thanks to our coach and all of the dedicated paddlers who put in a ton of training and always show so much heart!
