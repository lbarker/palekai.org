		<h2>Novice Year Overview</h2>
		<p>Pale Kai is a member of the Southern California Outrigger Racing Association (SCORA).  All paddlers must be proficient swimmers. Before our competitive season begins, you will be given a fitness test that includes treading water and then swimming for a measured distance.</p>
		<p>

		At first, practice happens on the weekends only. Then, beginning in March, we add in two practices during the week. In these practices, we will teach you all the skills needed to race outrigger canoes. Be prepared to have fun, get fit and meet a bunch of new friends.
		</p>

		After training for several months, the first official races will begin in May. There are currently 27 member clubs in SCORA and our official events take place up and down the coast between San Diego and Santa Barbara. The first races are Iron – that means it is a continuous race over distance without any crew changes. As a novice, your races will be approximately 4-5 miles in length. There are five iron races (schedule listed below ) that take place between early May and the end of June. 
		</p>
		<p>
		At the conclusion of the Iron Races, there is a Novice Dance Competition in San Diego that gives everyone the opportunity to make a fool of themselves. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Those Novice who develop proficiency may also be invited to compete in the 9-Man Season. This season consists of three separate events beginning in August – the Whitey Harrison Classic, The Pao Pao in Oceanside and the Catalina Crossing which races between Newport Beach and Avalon on Catalina Island. The first two races are approximately 20 miles in length. The Catalina Crossing is approximately 30 miles for the women and 34 miles for the men.
		</p>
		<p>
		In a 9-Man race, the paddlers are rotated in and out of the crew at about 15-20 minute intervals. The canoe is followed by a chase boat carrying three paddlers. At regular intervals, these paddlers will jump off of the chase boat and swim in line with the approaching canoe. As the canoe bears down on the same, three paddlers will jump out of the canoe to the right and the three replacement paddlers will climb in on the left. Over long distance races, this rotation of paddlers helps to maintain energy levels and keep the canoe moving at a swift pace. Hauling yourself into a moving canoe, however, takes skill and a certain level of fitness. If you want to compete in 9-man, better start getting yourself into shape as early as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
		By the time your novice season is over, you will have gained some new skills, increased your fitness levels and made a number of new friends.
